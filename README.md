# rateLimiter
This is a personal project on creating a rate limiter using Redis, Springboot. HTML is used to show a button on index.html. For an API Key, if the limit exceeds rate-limit threshold MAX_REQUESTS then the request is throttled with a message.

# Tech Stack (as planned)
1. Java Springboot - for backend
2. Redis - In memory database
3. HTML - for basic frontend
